# Enhancements

Overall there are several enhancements that this service would need to be made prodcution ready:

1. Implementing additional logic to handle expiring permits
2. SQLite was chosen due to time constraints, thus migrating from that technology to a more robust SQL Azure or Mongodb server is needed
3. Implementing a new query for menu items, meaning: if you'd like a hamburger you'd be able to query for the closest hamburger
4. The service needs a "what's open" feature where people are able to filter out food trucks that are currently closed
5. Obviously this service needs at least a web front end, most likely iOS and Android mobile apps (which were not done due to time constraints)
